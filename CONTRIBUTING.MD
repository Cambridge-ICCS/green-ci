# How to contribute

We welcome contributions from members of the community. We expect everyone engaging with this repository to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

If you have suggestions, please open an issue and create a pull request. Our main branch is protected and PRs require a code review.

At this point, we do not have any coding standards that we enforce - we are happy about any best-effort contributions and will attempt to give useful feedback to improve contributions where appropriate.

We politely ask you to not add non-reviewed (verified by a human) LLM-generated content to this repository.
