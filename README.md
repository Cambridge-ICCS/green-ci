# Green Software Engineering Practices for GitHub Actions Continuous Integration (CI) workflows

In this repository, we encourage the use of green software engineering practices
in continuous integration (CI) workflows implemented with GitHub Actions. It
provides [documentation](#best-practices) and templates on how to optimise CI
pipelines to reduce energy consumption, minimise resource usage, and promote
sustainable software development practices. By adopting these strategies,
developers can reduce the carbon footprint of their work and contribute to
environmentally friendly software engineering while maintaining efficient and
reliable CI processes.
