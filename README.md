# Green Software Engineering Practices for GitHub Actions Continuous Integration (CI) workflows

In this repository, we encourage the use of green software engineering practices
in continuous integration (CI) workflows implemented with GitHub Actions. It
provides [documentation](#best-practices) and templates on how to optimise CI
pipelines to reduce energy consumption, minimise resource usage, and promote
sustainable software development practices. By adopting these strategies,
developers can reduce the carbon footprint of their work and contribute to
environmentally friendly software engineering while maintaining efficient and
reliable CI processes.

## Existing Literature

There are a couple of studies on this topic, for example [Carbon Awareness in CI/CD by Classen et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18718)
and [Carbon-Aware Continuous Integration: Reducing Emissions Without Sacrificing Performance by Laskar](https://lorojournals.com/index.php/emsj/article/view/1581).
These mostly rely on scheduling workloads for low-carbon times or shifting to low-carbon locations, as well as reducing overhead in the workloads (e.g., through
minimisation of unnecessary runs and builds).

Tool like [Eco CI](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/eco-ci-energy-estimation) can help measuring/estimating the energy consumption of CI/CD runs which can help 
making informed decisions about adapting the runs. There are [a range of other tools](https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/the-10-best-tools-to-green-your-software/) out there
that can help you make your software development practices greener.
